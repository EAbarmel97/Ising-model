# About this repo:
This is a base julia interactive implementation of the Ising 2D model with some extra stuff. The user can choose temperature, length of the spin grid, initial temperature and initial magnetization or provide as well an interval of temperatures to simulate from.

# Notes:
1. Fourier analysis is carried out with the library "FFTW"
2. Plots are drawn using the 3th party library "Plots"
3. Linear regression is made by using base Julia
